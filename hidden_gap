🫁 Lung Cancer Treatment Escalation Analysis
Identifying a Hidden Health Data Science Gap Using Clinical Feature Engineering & Visualization
📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes a large lung cancer dataset to identify a hidden clinical risk subgroup that was not explicitly represented in the raw data. Although the dataset contains rich treatment, imaging, molecular, and clinical variables, it lacks integrated, actionable indicators to support proactive decision-making.
Using clinically informed feature engineering and visualization, this project uncovers patterns of treatment escalation and tumor aggressiveness that were previously invisible.
❗ Problem / Health Data Science Gap
Healthcare datasets often record detailed variables (e.g., individual therapies, biomarkers, imaging features), but fail to summarize them into interpretable, clinically meaningful indicators.
In this dataset:
Treatment intensity was recorded only as separate therapy flags
Tumor aggressiveness was scattered across imaging, PET, and molecular variables
No early-warning or pre-escalation risk signal existed
👉 As a result, a high-risk subgroup of patients was hidden in plain sight.

✅ Solution Approach
This project bridges that gap by creating three clinically meaningful constructs:
1️⃣ Treatment Burden Index
A weighted score summarizing overall treatment intensity across:
Chemotherapy
Immunotherapy
Targeted therapy
Radiation therapy

2️⃣ Multimodal Tumor Aggressiveness Score
An integrated biology score built from:
Radiomics features
PET imaging metrics
Molecular markers (e.g., PD-L1, tumor mutational burden)

3️⃣ Pre-Escalation Risk Flag
A binary indicator identifying patients with:
High treatment burden and
High tumor aggressiveness or advanced stage
This flag enables early identification of patients at risk of treatment escalation.

📊 Key Visualizations
The analysis is supported by clear, interpretable graphs:
Bar Chart: Treatment Burden Gap between low-risk and high-risk patients
Line Chart: Therapy utilization differences across treatment modalities
Scatter Plots:
Tumor aggressiveness vs. treatment burden
With and without jitter to reveal patient-level patterns
These visualizations transform raw clinical data into actionable insights.

🔍 Key Findings
~25% of patients form a distinct high-risk subgroup
High-risk patients show:
~3× higher treatment burden
Consistent escalation across all therapy types
Higher tumor aggressiveness and disease severity
These patterns existed in the data but were not identifiable without feature engineering

🧠 Why This Matters
Demonstrates the value of clinical reasoning + data science
Moves beyond black-box modeling to interpretable decision support
Highlights how Health Data Science can support proactive, rather than reactive, care
Applicable to:
Clinical analytics
Oncology informatics
Pharmacist-led medication safety initiatives

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

🚀 Future Extensions
Survival analysis by pre-escalation risk group
Explainable ML models for escalation prediction
Integration into clinical dashboards
Validation on external oncology datasets

✨ Key Takeaway
Rich healthcare datasets are often silent. Clinically informed feature engineering and visualization are what turn data into decisions.
